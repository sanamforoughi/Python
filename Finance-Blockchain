#Basics of how to build a blockchain from scratch, blockchain is basically a distributed database, with a set of rules for verifying new additions to the database.

#Start off by tracking the accounts of two imaginary people, who will trade virtual money with each other.
#1-create a transaction pool of incoming transactions
#2-validate those transactions
#3-and make them into a block
#A cryptographic hash function is a hash function which takes an input (or 'message') and returns a fixed-size alphanumeric string. )
#A helper function is a function that performs part of the computation of another function. Helper functions are used to make your programs easier to read by giving descriptive names to computations.

#f5 to spit out private crypto hash key

#address

#block.io fetches transaction data using history('addr')

def hashMe (msg=""):
	# For convenience, this is a helper function that wraps our hashing algo
	if type(msg)!=str:
			msg = json.dumps(msg,sort_keys=True) # If we don't sort keys, we can't guarantee repeatability

	if sys.version_info.major == 2:
    		return 
    unicode(hashlib.sha256(msg).hexdigest(),'utf-8')
	else:
			return hashlib.sha256(str(msg).encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()

# Next, we want to create a function to generate exchange between user1 and user2 
#We'll indicate withdrawals with negative numbers, and deposits with positive numbers. We'll construct our transactions to always be between the two users of our system, and make sure that the deposit is the same magnitude as the witdrawal- i.e. that we're neither creating nor destroying money.

import random 
random.seed(0)

def makeTransaction(maxValue=3):

 # This will create valid transactions in the range of (1,maxValue)
    sign      = int(random.getrandbits(1))*2 - 1  

 # This will randomly choose -1 or 1

    amount    = random.randint(1,maxValue)
    user1Pays = sign * amount
    user2Pays   = -1 * user1Pays
 # By construction, this will always return transactions that respect the conservation of tokens.
 
 # However, note that we have not done anything to check whether these overdraft an account
    return {u'user1':user1Pays,u'user2':user2Pays}

    # Here you are creating a large set of transactions, then chunk them into blocks.

    txnBuffer= [makeTransaction () for i in range(30)]

    # Next step: making the blocks
    # take the first k transactions from the transaction buffer and turn them into a block
    # define a method for checking the validity of the transaction we've pulled into the block
	# validity function: checks that the input values are valid UTXOs( unspent transaction), 
	# that the outputs of the transaction are no greater than the input
	# that the keys used for the signatures are valid
	# Ethereum: the validation function checks tha the smart contracts were faithfully executed and respect gas limits?
	# gas limits in Ethereum is a measure of computational effort.

	#Build a basic token system:
	#1-Sum of deposits and withdrawals must be 0 (tokens are neither created nor destroyed)
	#2-A user's account must have sufficient funds to cover any withdrawals

# txn = numeric values for the transfer amount

# account balance = state

	def updateState(txn, state):

# Returns: Updated state, with additional users added to state if necessary
    # NOTE: This does not not validate the transaction- just updates the state!
    
    # If the transaction is valid, then update the state

state = state.copy() # As dictionaries are mutable, let's avoid any confusion by creating a working copy of the data.
    for key in txn:
        if key in state.keys():
            state[key] += txn[key]
        else:
            state[key] = txn[key]
    return state


def isValidTxn(txn,state): # txn = Assume that the transaction is a dictionary keyed by account names

    # Check that the sum of the deposits and withdrawals is 0
    if sum(txn.values()) is not 0:
        return False


  # Check that the transaction does not cause an overdraft
    for key in txn.keys():
        if key in state.keys(): 
            acctBalance = state[key] # check to see if there's money in the key
        else:
            acctBalance = 0
        if (acctBalance + txn[key]) < 0:
            return False
    
    return True

# examples of transactions

state = {u'user1':5,u'Bob':5}

print(isValidTxn({u'user1': -3, u'Bob': 3},state))  # Basic transaction- this works great!
print(isValidTxn({u'user1': -4, u'Bob': 3},state))  # But we can't create or destroy tokens!
print(isValidTxn({u'user1': -6, u'Bob': 6},state))  # We also can't overdraft our account.
print(isValidTxn({u'user1': -4, u'Bob': 2,'Lisa':2},state)) # Creating new users is valid
print(isValidTxn({u'user1': -4, u'Bob': 3,'Lisa':2},state)) # But the same rules still apply, THERE NEEDS TO BE EQUILIBRIUM

#Building the Blockchain: Now that you have the transactions, you need to build the blocks.
#Define the genesis block aka the first block in the system.
#The genesis block is not linked to any prior block

#Create an account for two users and give them 50 coins each.

state = {u'user1}
